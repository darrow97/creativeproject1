              The war between good and evil has been waged since the dawn of time. In ancient times,
              stories were told of great individuals that had god-like abilities taking the mantle
              of 'hero' to save and better the lives of everyone. And sometimes it was just to save their
              love interest. In modern times, these individuals have awesome powers that are only limited
              by the imagination of the character creators. And these characters have stolen our hearts.
            </p>

            <p>
              The villains that rise to meet these heroes also have powers and use them for evil. Some
              do so because their character is corrupt, while others are mislead, and others still walk
              the fine line between good and evil. These line walkers are known as anti-heroes.
            </p>
            <p>
              Where do your fancies fall on the spectrum? Do you favor the heroes, villains, or anti-heroes?
              Independent of your preference, this Superhero Emporium showcases some heroes and their enemies,
              the villains. Take a journey as you come to know them better!
